# Everything in Python are objects.
# This means that everything that's created is an
# instance on a pre-defined class, or a self-defined class.
# These instances are in memory (hence named objects), and
# has access to the functions defined in the original classes
# and is called methods.

# 1. Creating a name in the namespace
# This example shows creating a variable.
# Know that this variable `name` is created as an instance
# of the str() class.
name = "Rob"
print(type(name))
print(dir(name))

# 2. Creating a custom class
class Animal:
    """Animal Class"""

    def __init__(self):
        """Constructor for Animal Class"""
        pass

    def print_name(self, name):
        print(f"{name} is an Animal")


# Creating an instance out of Animal class
my_animal = Animal()
my_animal.print_name("Deer")

# 3. self
# `self` is a contruct which refers to the instance
# of the class itself.
